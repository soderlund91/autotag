## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌟 Dynamic Lists from Trakt & MDBList
Make your library feel alive with tags that update automatically every day.
* **Trending Now** — always shows what's currently hot worldwide.
* **Popular & Top Rated** — self-managing "Best of" lists.
* **Personal Curations** — sync your own Trakt/MDBList lists (e.g., "Best of 80s", "Dad's Favorites").
* **Automagical Sync** — link a URL, and the plugin handles the rest. Items are added and removed automatically.

### 📚 Automated Collection Management
Beyond tagging, the plugin can manage your Emby Collections.
* **Auto-Create** — create a corresponding Emby Collection while a list is active.
* **Dynamic Membership** — items join/leave the collection as the list changes.
* **Only Collection Mode** — enable "Disable Item Tagging" to keep item metadata clean while still enjoying organized collections.
* **Smart Removal** — when a collection is disabled or its schedule ends, the plugin automatically deletes it from Emby.

### 🧩 Local Sources: Collections & Playlists
No external API needed. Use what's already in your library.
* Tag items based on existing **Emby Collections** or **Playlists**.
* Combine with schedules to create time-limited promotions of curated content.

### 📅 Advanced Scheduling
Set tags and collections to be active only during specific time windows. AutoTag handles cleanup when the window closes.
* **Annual** — e.g., "Christmas Movies" active Dec 1–31 every year.
* **Weekly** — e.g., "Friday Movie Night" active only on Fridays.
* **Specific Dates** — for one-time events or marathons.

### 🔬 MediaInfo Filtering
Tag items based on their actual technical properties—no manual curation required.
* **Rule-based UI** — build filters from a property dropdown with context-sensitive value inputs.
* **Property categories** — Video (4K, HDR, HEVC, H.264, SD), Audio (Atmos, DTS-HD MA, AC3, AAC, Stereo, Mono, channels), Content (Genre, Studio, Actor/Director, Rating, Language), Metrics (Year, Runtime, Community Rating, Critic Rating).
* **Numeric operators** — `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `=` for ratings, year, runtime, and channel count.
* **Text matching** — case-insensitive contains for Genre, Studio, Actor, Director, and Language.
* **AND/OR within groups** — combine multiple criteria per group with AND or OR logic.
* **AND/OR between groups** — chain multiple criterion groups together.
* Backward compatible with previously saved configs.

**Example use cases:**
* Tag all 4K Atmos movies → `4K AND Atmos`
* Tag action movies from 2020+ with a rating above 7 → `Genre: Action AND Year >= 2020 AND CommunityRating >= 7`
* Tag content suitable for a specific setup → `DTS-HD MA OR Atmos`

### 🏠 Home Screen
Keep home screen sections in sync across all your Emby users—automatically.
* **Source user** — pick one user whose home screen layout is the "master" configuration.
* **Target users** — select one or more users whose home screens will be updated to mirror the source.
* **Scheduled task** — runs every 30 minutes by default, or manually trigger a sync from the plugin page.
* **Live status** — the plugin page shows last sync time, result, and how many sections were copied.

This is ideal for multi-user households or Emby servers with guests, where you want everyone to see the same curated home screen without manually configuring each account.

### 🔄 True Synchronization
AutoTag doesn't just add tags; it **enforces** them.
* Item enters your list → **Tag/Collection Added**.
* Item leaves your list → **Tag/Collection Removed**.
* Your library always reflects the current state of the list.

### 🛡️ Safety & Stability
* **Fail-Safe Cleanup** — if a remote list fails to download, the plugin skips cleanup for that tag/collection to prevent accidental data loss.
* **Dry Run Mode** — test your configuration in the logs without modifying anything in your library.
* **Live Logging** — view the execution log directly inside the plugin settings with real-time status updates.
